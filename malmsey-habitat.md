# The Malmsey Habitat Family of Viruses

So far in this directory I've uploaded the original source code of the Malmsey Habitat v1.3 virus. There are other versions that are considerably different from each other, as each one was devised to demonstrate a new and/or novel virus technology.

Once I locate the other sources (including for quite a few other viruses I wrote or helped write), they'll also appear here.

Archive.org has a visual demo of the initial Malmsey Habitat v1.00 payload. All of them have variations of the crunchy face animation, but with different version numbers and messages (such as Happy Birthday Pob!!! triggered on September 30th to celebrate Pob (Robbie) Barloper's birthday).
