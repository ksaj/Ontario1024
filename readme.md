# Scary stuff.

Don't look at it. Unless you're one of *us*. Then go ahead. Right this way...

Herein lies a bunch of sneaky early 90's computer virus-related code samples. Only a few of them are defanged to just show the interesting technological effects. Others are just the fangs, so your mileage may vary. The viruses are the real McCoy, straight from the source(s).

All of this was written in the early 90's, so it only works on PC's from 30 years ago. Don't give me grief if you crash your Tandy emulator with it. The ideas are still modern and valid if they were to ever get updated. When you consider how the anti-debug samples work, you'll get why the recent Intel vulnerabilities like Meltdown and Sceptre didn't surprise me one bit.

TODO: Maybe one day I'll add an index to point out specifically what all these samples do. Until then, I leave it to your ingenuity. I imagine a fair amount of back knowledge is needed to understand the scope and severity of issues this code demonstrates.
