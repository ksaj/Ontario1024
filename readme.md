# The Lezbo virus

Here is a virus from the early 90's that I experimented with. It only runs under very ancient conditions, so I feel safe enough releasing it. Compile and run it from an emulated 386 or less capable PC.

Here's the original text I included with it:

```quote
The Lezbo virus can infect .COM files, .EXE files, and .OVL (OVerLay files).  
It is a full stealth virus which hides the virus size increase of infected fil
es.  The time stamp is altered, as described in Chapter Five's discussion on d
irectory stealth.

Notice how the virus installation code must determine whether the host is an
.EXE or .COM type file.  This is because .EXE files require much more process
ing before an effective infection can take place.
Other information is included in the virus source code comments.
